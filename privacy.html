  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
IMPORTANT: THIS PRIVACY POLICY GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE LUMINAI APP. BY USING THIS APP, YOU AGREE TO ALL TERMS BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THE APP.

1. WHO WE ARE

LuminAI ("we," "us," or "our") operates the LuminAI mobile application ("App") as an AI-powered mental wellness support tool. We are not a healthcare provider, do not provide medical or psychiatric services, and are not subject to HIPAA or similar medical privacy laws.

2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We may collect and process the following categories of information:
• Required: Name, email address (for account setup and authentication)
• Optional: Age, pronouns, gender identity, marital status, and reason for seeking support
• Encrypted: Session transcripts, notes, summaries, session history (encrypted at rest; inaccessible to LuminAI staff)
• Technical: Device information, usage logs, IP address, access dates/times
• Payment: Payment data is processed exclusively by third-party providers and never stored by LuminAI

3. HOW WE USE INFORMATION

Your information is used to:
• Operate, maintain, and improve the App
• Communicate with you regarding your account or service
• Provide secure storage and retrieval of your encrypted session data
• Fulfill legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service
• Prevent fraud, abuse, or illegal activity

4. HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION

• Third-Party AI Processing: By using the App, you understand and agree that all session data, prompts, and messages may be transmitted to third-party artificial intelligence providers (such as OpenAI and similar) for processing. We have no control over, or responsibility for, how these providers use, store, or disclose your information. Their use is governed by their own privacy policies, not ours.
• Legal: We may disclose information as required by law, court order, or to protect our rights, property, or safety.
• We do NOT sell or share your personal information for marketing purposes.

5. DATA SECURITY

• We employ commercially reasonable security measures, including encryption at rest and in transit where possible. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. Session data sent to AI partners is NOT encrypted by us once it leaves our servers. You use the App and transmit information at your own risk.
• LuminAI staff and contractors cannot access your encrypted session transcripts, notes, or summaries.

6. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION

• You may delete your data at any time via the App. We will remove all personal information within a commercially reasonable timeframe, subject to technical and legal constraints.
• Some technical or anonymous data may persist as required for security, auditing, or backup.

7. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

• The App is strictly for users 18 years and older. We do not knowingly collect or retain information from anyone under 18. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a minor, contact us immediately at support@luminai.app.

8. INTERNATIONAL USERS, JURISDICTION, AND NON-US LAWS

• The App is controlled and operated from Colorado, USA. Your data will be stored and processed in the United States and may be accessible to US authorities.
• If you access the App from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk. You are solely responsible for compliance with local laws. The App is not intended for use where prohibited by law.
• To the fullest extent permitted by law, this Privacy Policy is governed exclusively by the laws of the State of Colorado, USA, and any disputes are subject to binding arbitration in Denver, Colorado, as further detailed in our Terms of Service.

9. NOT MEDICAL, NOT HIPAA-COVERED, NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL CARE

• LuminAI is NOT a healthcare provider, does NOT provide medical, psychiatric, or psychological care, does NOT create any therapist-patient relationship, and is NOT governed by HIPAA or equivalent laws.
• The App is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or mental health condition. If you need medical, mental health, or emergency care, you must contact a licensed professional or call emergency services immediately.
• By using this App, you waive any claim that we have any duty of care to you, or that any use of the App constitutes medical or therapeutic advice or services.

10. YOUR RIGHTS

• You may access, correct, or delete your personal data through the App. For other requests, contact support@luminai.app. We may require identity verification.
• We may deny requests that are abusive, unlawful, or technically impossible to fulfill.

11. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

• We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Updates will be posted in the App, and your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
